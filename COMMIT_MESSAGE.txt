Cleanup: move root backup files to backup/ and remove placeholders

- Consolidated historical backup files into `backup/` and `backup/root-backups/`.
- Removed placeholder `about.markdown` and `index.markdown` from repository root to avoid Jekyll duplicate destination conflicts.
- Added "Backup & Recovery" section to `README.md` explaining how to restore these files if needed.

Notes:
- Original backups are preserved under `backup/` and `backup/root-backups/`.
- Run `bundle exec jekyll build` to verify the site locally after restoring any file.
